            <p>A long forgotten underhive dome built to surround a colossal tomb complex, Beladon's Rest is a
              sprawling labyrinth of rusted and decaying pre-fabricated shelters, derelict manufactories, and ancient cyclopean machinery.
              Recently rediscovered by enterprising Domerunners, Beladon's Rest is newly lit by muzzles flares and lasfire as the gangs of the 
              Underhive seek to carve out new territory from the ruins.</p>
            <p>As battle rages throughout the reclaimed hab-blocks and around industrial monoliths, rumours spread that Beladon's Rest may
              not be as abandoned as it seems</p>
            <p>The Devastation of Beladon's Rest is based around a Dominion campaign for Necromunda Underhive with a focus on narrative and role-playing.</p>
